Python source code, 2 database files (.sqlite) and graphic interface file (.ui)

You can replace the .py file by an executable to avoid having to install python and the libraries

(exe file here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HT_SIVm93yvJDs65nukCRozWbvVoS5cA)

Just need to place the 2 sqlite, the ui, and either the .py or .exe file in the same directory and execute it
